## Description

**J2S** is a new approach for static Sign Language recognition, obtained from the combination of a regression stage and a classification one in a sequential way. It is an end-to-end trainable multi-task model with static or dynamic loss weighting.  
For more details refer to the paper.

## Code
The model implementatin can be easily opened in Google Colab.
